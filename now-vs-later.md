There are pros and cons to both. By doing things now, you can ensure they get
done and aren't a blocker when you next go to do work on them. Additionally, if
this is part of a piece of work you're already doing, you already have the
context around it which you'd have to build up before you can do the thing.
However, we amy not have all the context to do the thing correctly.
