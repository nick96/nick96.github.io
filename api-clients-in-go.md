abstract: Writing API clients in Go. What are good patterns? and how can be make it easier?

I really like Go. It's a great language and does a really good job of leading
you down the path of writing clean, understandable and testable code. It's one
of the few languages where I've been able to look at most open source projects
and easily be able to understand what is happening. It also helps that it has
really nice tooling around it. However, one part that I feel always lets the
language down, building API clients. Once you have a nicely abstracted client
it can be really great and nice to use but actually writing one always seems to
be such a pain and requires a lot of boilerplate code, but what is the actual
problem? I've going to have a look at some API clients I've tried to write and
some API clients I've used and like to see what it is.
